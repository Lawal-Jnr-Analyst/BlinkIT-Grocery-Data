# 🛒 Blinkit Sales Performance Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project features a comprehensive sales dashboard for Blinkit, India's last-minute delivery app. By analyzing transactional data across multiple outlet types, locations, and product categories, the dashboard identifies key drivers of revenue, including fat content distribution, item type performance, outlet size contribution, and regional tier breakdowns.
The goal is to provide stakeholders with a clear visualization of sales trends and outlet performance, helping to optimize inventory strategies, improve outlet-level profitability, and strengthen decision-making across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 markets.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Power BI (Data Visualization & Dashboard Design)
- Power Query (Data Cleaning and Transformation)
- DAX (Custom Measures & KPI Calculations)

## 🔍 Problem, Action & Result
- The Problem: Blinkit had inconsistent sales performance across outlet types and locations, but lacked visibility into which segments were underperforming and why margins varied significantly across tiers.
- The Action: I built DAX measures to calculate average sales, total revenue, and item visibility by outlet type, and used Power Query to clean and segment the data by fat content, item category, and outlet establishment year. These were visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard with dynamic filter panels.
- The Result: Identified that Supermarket Type 1 accounts for $787.55K (65%+) of total sales despite similar average ratings across all outlet types, and revealed that Tier 3 locations outperform Tier 1 by over $135K in total sales, highlighting a significant underinvestment in lower-tier market expansion.

## 💡 Data Insights
- Total sales reached $1.20M across 9K items with an average sales value of $141 and an average customer rating of 3.9, reflecting steady demand with room for service quality improvement.
- Outlet establishment data reveals a peak in 2018 at $205K before a sharp decline, suggesting market saturation or increased competition impacting newer outlet performance post-2018.
- Household and Dairy items lead all item types with $149 and $148 in average sales respectively, while Baking goods trail at $126, indicating a clear opportunity to reassess low-performing category strategies.
- Tier 3 locations generate the highest revenue at $472.13K, outperforming Tier 2 ($393.15K) and Tier 1 ($336.40K), challenging the assumption that higher-tier urban markets drive the most value.
